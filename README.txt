This is the beginning of a project that I used to work for ITL (intelligent traffic light).
It's a simulation of a web app to track the traffic light system in real time if it were to receive signals from a connected device.
The idea was to scale this and have data about multiple intersections where the traffic light is not fully automated (scheduled).
Technologies used: python, Flask, html, css, javascript.
